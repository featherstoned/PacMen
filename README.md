# PacMen
#### Week 7 Module MIT Full Stack Course | Portfolio Ready
##### Description: 
A game with multiple PacMan characters moving randomly on the screen. Velocities and direction are generated randomly when they collide with borders of browser window. Animated by iterating through an array of 4 PacMan images and updates their positions and velocities continuously. New PacMan is added to game by clicking Add PacMan button.

##### How To Run: 
Fork and clone repo to your local machine. Open "index.html" file to load page to your browser.

##### Roadmap of Future Improvements: 
I plan to link a stylesheet and add a background color and cool font. Add an "End Game" button to stop animation.
